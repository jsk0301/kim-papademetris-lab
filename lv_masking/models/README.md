# List of models

5-13-2020:
- Using John's UNet2D script on preliminary small dataset

5-22-2020:
- Created UNet2d from scratch with PyTorch, short training test

5-28-2020:
- Used MONAI implementation of a 2d Unet

6-3-2020:
- Full training test of my from-scratch UNet

6-8-2020:
- Testing effect of patch size: patches were 256x256x1
- Results: mostly messy

6-9-2020:
- Testing effect of patch size: patches were 64x64x1
- Results: no output masks at all??? Theory: blank patches dominate dataset
