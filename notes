get inference request: in form of http request
ignore json input


flask server accepts multipart requests
- each part is 1 file
- binary blob thrown at container
- segmentations returned as binary blobs
dicom_instances:

inference test tool

External executable within function

separate file for my own stuff

dicom_instances: list of byte objects
pydicom.read_file: returns dicom
- pydicom -> numpy
- write dicom_instances to files, then convert to nifti, need to save in temp directory

return response_json, 


how docker works;
to read and write files, either a. a host computer directory is mounted on the virtual container (but server is now bound to exact locations) or b. use a web server, interfacing is standardized. any binary file is called a "blob", has to be decoded, saved, etc.
