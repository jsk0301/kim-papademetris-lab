My work for Dan's LV masking project is under the lv_masking folder.

- `t1_unet2d.ipynb` contains my own PyTorch implementation of a UNet
- `t2_monai_testing.ipynb` has the things I've tried using the monai package

With access to tensor1, I'm planning to try to come up with a list of different hyperparameters/transformations to test and try training a bunch of models and collect results.
